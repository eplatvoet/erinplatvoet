      <p> Hi! My name is Erin Platvoet, and I recently just embarked on a new chapter in my life. After nearly 14 years
        in visual merchandising, I decided I wanted to pursue an old hobby - coding! <i>The way things fell into perfect
          place still leaves me a bit surprised, but I guess everything truly does happen for a reason!</i> I, like many
        others in my generation, became familiar with coding in the Myspace era. Creating a new layout for my profile on
        a weekly basis became my new normal, and I soon began creating layouts for my friends. Spending hours upon hours
        plugging away at codes, inserting differnt colors, styles, images, etc. was my idea of a good time! I was
        enamored with the satisfaction of getting my HTML codes to work, but unfortunately put my hobby to the side as
        the pressures of being a full-time college student started to settle in. </p>
      <p>Life continued on, and I went from being a full-time student to a full-time student working full-time, to a
        college graduate with a full-time job. Unfortunately, free time became harder and harder to find as time passed,
        and coding became "that hobby I had in high school and college." Every now and then, I would dabble with some
        HTML codes, but because it wasn't relevant to my job, I didn't find it as useful. As years passed, I started to
        realize that I wasn't completely happy with my job. I had hoped things would change once we had relocated,
        however, they had not. I was reminded of a question I had during a personal interview in college - where do you
        see yourself in 5, 10, 15 years? My answer: I don't want to set predictions for myself, but the only thing that
        matters to me is that I'm happy. Truly, truly happy.</p>
      <p>I had the personal happiness - I had recently married the love of my life, we have two cats who I adore, I have
        a great support system of friends, family, and friends that became family. I was thriving mentally being back in
        New Jersey and being so close to so many people I love... and the beach! I found myself being happy basically
        everywhere except at work. I realized I needed to love waking up and going to work, and I unfortunately wasn't
        able to say that anymore. I made a list of everything I liked to do, what types of jobs I could do, and the
        types of jobs I'd want to do. I began to remember the love I had for coding, the satisfaction of a working code
        (especially on the first shot!), the way I was able to have some creativity, and the way I was able to
        constantly learn new information. Something in the back of my mind was triggered, and I immediately googled
        "Rutgers Coding Bootcamp" - one of the programs I had briefly explored in 2013 before I had moved to New
        England. After a conversation with my husband, and hearing him say "I haven't seen you this excited in a long
        time- GO FOR IT!" I decided to apply, and here we are!</p>
